Core Application Features
The application has been built with a focus on mobile optimization and responsiveness, while providing a comprehensive set of image processing capabilities:

Image Format Handling

Supports JPG, PNG, and JPEG formats
Includes validation for file types and size (5MB limit)
Automatically resizes large images for better performance
Provides clear error messages for invalid uploads


Processing Operations

Grayscale Conversion with adjustable intensity levels
Multiple Blurring Options:

Gaussian blur with adjustable kernel size
Median blur for noise reduction
Bilateral filter with customizable parameters for edge-preserving smoothing


Edge Detection:

Canny edge detection with adjustable thresholds
Sobel operator (horizontal, vertical, and combined)
Laplacian edge detection with kernel size control


Morphological Operations:

Dilation with customizable kernel size and iterations
Erosion with adjustable parameters
